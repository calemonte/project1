# Dinner and a Movie

Created by Ed Beaudet, Jason Horowitz, Lily Simmons, and Kenny Whitebloom for Project #1 as part of the University of Pennsylvania Coding Bootcamp.

# App Description

It’s Friday afternoon at work and you’re dreaming about the weekend. When you get home you’re feeling that Friday night fatigue, you know you’re staying in, and don’t want to make anymore decisions. Well, that’s where we come in! Let us make the decision for you…

Just use whatever energy you have left from the work week to tell us what you have in your fridge, what movies you’re into, and we’ll let you know the ideal dinner and movie to start your weekend.
